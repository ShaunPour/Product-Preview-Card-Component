## My process
Given how straightforward this project was, there wasn't much of a process. I set up the basic html structure at the start and played around with the css to get the mobile first responsiveness working as I wanted it.

I went back to the html later to add a few more sections in order to get certain parts of it structured better though.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
This project was very useful for getting back into using flex in a project - albeit on a smaller scale (I've been away from css for a while as most of my projects have been with Javascript where the css was provided, used bootstrap or done with React) and this project was great as a refresher.
